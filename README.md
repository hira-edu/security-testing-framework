# Security Testing Framework

A professional-grade, single-file security testing framework for evaluating exam proctoring software integrity. This tool is designed exclusively for legitimate security research and vulnerability assessment by authorized security professionals.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework assists security teams in:
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities in exam proctoring software
- Testing defensive mechanisms
- Improving security posture of educational integrity tools
- Conducting authorized penetration testing

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### One-Click Installation
```bash
# Windows users - just double-click:
build_installer.bat

# Or run from command line:
python build_single_file.py
```

This creates a single executable: `SecurityTestingFramework.exe` (~120MB)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework uses a modular architecture with:
- **Core Engine**: Python-based testing orchestration
- **Native Modules**: C++ components for low-level operations
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly testing interface
- **CLI Tools**: Scriptable command-line interface
- **Report Generator**: Comprehensive security assessment reports

## üì¶ Components

- **Screen Capture Testing**: Multiple capture method validation
- **Process Monitoring**: Process manipulation detection
- **API Hooking Tests**: System API interception verification
- **Memory Analysis**: Runtime memory inspection tools
- **Network Monitoring**: Network communication analysis

## üîß Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Python 3.11+
- Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools)
- CMake 3.20+

### Build Process
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/security-testing-framework.git
cd security-testing-framework

# Run the build script
python build_single_file.py --release

# Output: dist/SecurityTestingFramework.exe
```

## üöÄ Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)
```bash
SecurityTestingFramework.exe
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Run specific test suite
SecurityTestingFramework.exe --test screen_capture --target "LockDownBrowser.exe"

# Generate security report
SecurityTestingFramework.exe --report --output security_audit.pdf

# Silent mode with configuration
SecurityTestingFramework.exe --silent --config test_config.json
```
