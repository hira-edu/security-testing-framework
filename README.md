# Security Testing Framework

A professional-grade, single-file security testing framework for evaluating exam proctoring software integrity. This tool is designed exclusively for legitimate security research and vulnerability assessment by authorized security professionals.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework assists security teams in:
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities in exam proctoring software
- Testing defensive mechanisms
- Improving security posture of educational integrity tools
- Conducting authorized penetration testing

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Method 1: One-Line Installation (Recommended)

#### PowerShell (Run as Administrator):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Alternative PowerShell command:
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### CMD/Command Prompt:
```cmd
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.bat -o %TEMP%\stf-install.bat && %TEMP%\stf-install.bat
```

If you prefer the PowerShell installer but you are in CMD, use:
```cmd
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Method 2: Download Pre-Built Release

Download the latest `SecurityTestingFramework.exe` directly:
```
https://github.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/releases/latest
```

### Method 3: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework.git
cd security-testing-framework
build_installer.bat
```

This creates a single executable: `SecurityTestingFramework.exe` (~120MB)

### Advanced Installation Options

#### PowerShell with Parameters:
```powershell
# Install to custom location
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex -InstallPath "C:\Tools\STF"

# Portable installation (current directory)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex -Portable

# Silent installation (no prompts)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex -Silent

# Without shortcuts
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.ps1 | iex -NoDesktopShortcut -NoStartMenu
```

#### CMD with Options:
```cmd
# Portable mode (install to current directory)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat --portable

# Without shortcuts
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hira-edu/security-testing-framework/main/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat --no-shortcuts
```

### Uninstallation

#### Windows:
```powershell
# If installed via PowerShell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\SecurityTestingFramework\uninstall.ps1"

# If installed via CMD
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SecurityTestingFramework\uninstall.bat
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework uses a modular architecture with:
- **Core Engine**: Python-based testing orchestration
- **Native Modules**: C++ components for low-level operations
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly testing interface
- **CLI Tools**: Scriptable command-line interface
- **Report Generator**: Comprehensive security assessment reports

## üì¶ Components

- **Screen Capture Testing**: Multiple capture method validation
- **Process Monitoring**: Process manipulation detection
- **API Hooking Tests**: System API interception verification
- **Memory Analysis**: Runtime memory inspection tools
- **Network Monitoring**: Network communication analysis

## üîß Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Python 3.11+
- Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools)
- CMake 3.20+

### Build Process
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/security-testing-framework.git
cd security-testing-framework

# Run the build script
python build_single_file.py --release

# Output: dist/SecurityTestingFramework.exe
```

## üöÄ Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)
```bash
SecurityTestingFramework.exe
```

### Command Line Interface
